# Package Development

Here is pre-built [vscode-css-languageserver](https://github.com/vscode-langservers/vscode-css-languageserver).

You don't have to go here if you are just an end user.

For a plugin developer, to update the included language server,
run `./compile-language-server.sh`. The build result will be in `./out/`.
